#### Conclusion
>  **n : number of steps**
>
>  **d : the distance between the man and the lamp post.**

Delta is the difference between the expected value and the actual value. The more tests, the more likely Delta will be to zero
$$
\sqrt n = d \pm \Delta
$$

###### Prove

According to the given topic, we can only get the expected value of the distance, that is, to find the following expected value
$$
E_n(X^2+Y^2)=\sum(x^2+y^2)P(X=x,Y=y)
$$

According to the same possibility of the four directions, it can be concluded that
$$
P(X=x+1,Y=y)=P(X=x+1,Y=y|X=x,Y=y)P(X=x,Y=y)=\frac{1}{4}P(X=x,Y=y)
$$

Thereforeï¼Œfor N=n+1 :
$$
E_{n+1}(X^2+Y^2)=\frac{1}{4}\sum {[(x+1)^2+y^2]+[x^2+(y+1)^2]+[(x-1)^2+y^2]+[x^2+(y-1)^2]} P(X=x,Y=y)
$$

A fter simplificated, we got :
$$
E_{n+1}(X^2+Y^2)=\sum (x^2+y^2+1)P(X=x,Y=y)=E_n(X^2+Y^2)+\sum P(X=x,Y=y)
$$
Absolutely
$$
\sum P(X=x,Y=y) = 1
$$
So, we got
$$
E_{n}(X^2+Y^2)=n
$$

That is to say, the number of steps is the square of the expected Euclidean distance
